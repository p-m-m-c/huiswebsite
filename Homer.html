        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <p class='text-justify'>
          Homer is unarguably the greatest poet of ancient times. He is the composer of Iliad and the Odyssey which hold the privilege of being the greatest poems of world literature. Although it is not known for sure when Homer was born, the time of his birth
          is estimated somewhere between the 8th and 9th century B.C, however, another school of thought states that Homer lived during the era of the Trojan war in the early 12th century B.C. Homer belonged to Greece by birth but the exact location of
          his birth and living is also doubtful. Some believe that he was born on Chios Island while others say he lived in Ionia. The dialect and descriptions in his poems point towards the latter. Not much is known about Homer the person and therefore,
          his poems are used to depict his personality and life. For example, Homer is thought to be blind due to the description presented of the blind bard in The Odyssey. In fact, it is also supposed that the word Homer was used to address blind men
          roaming the streets reciting classical poetry. Other than being a poet, historians believe that Homer was also a story teller and a court singer.
